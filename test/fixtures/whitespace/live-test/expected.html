<p>The Metalsmith ecosystem needed a fresh approach to HTML optimization. <a href="//github.com/whymarrh/metalsmith-html-minifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metalsmith HTML Minifier</a> was once the go-to plugin. However, it has grown stale due to unaddressed security issues. It is built as a wrapper for <a href="//github.com/kangax/html-minifier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML Minifier</a>, which has a security fix, but sadly, the wrapper has not been updated. This gap prompted me to build a new solution with modern development practices while maintaining simplicity and security.</p>
